# Linear-Regression-HOTP
A step by step approach to predicting house costs depending on the size of the house
# Set up:
- run `./generate_csv_data.sh` to generate the `houses_data.csv` file
- Alternatively using an Independent script: generate `houses.csv` using the `generate_csv.py`
- run `./run-script.sh` to plot the necessary graphs 
- Visualize the Hypothesis and cost function
- Parameterized learning and finally analyze our result set
